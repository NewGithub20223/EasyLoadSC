**i am asking nicely NO FORKING PLS**

welcome to my script in this script it makes 3 custom loading
now since this dosent have a PIP install yet you will have to 
install this manually

**installation:
download the zip file and put the EasyLoad.py to "%localappdata%\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib" (change 311 to your python version)**


now for examples:


```
# import
import easyload
# setup load
load = loadbar()
# start the loading text
load.load1()
```
